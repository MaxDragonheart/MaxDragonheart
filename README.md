Hi! 
My name is [Massimiliano Moraca](https://massimilianomoraca.it/) aka MaxDragonheart. Why MaxDragonheart? When was young I liked very much [Dragonheart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonheart) so, many years later, when social network era born I tried to use Dragonheart as name but it was busy. MaxDragonheart was free, simple. :smile: 

I'm an environmental engineer employed on GIS field as freelance. I'm fascinate from the Open Source world. Thanks the Open Source world I could learn the base of programming and thanks these skills I was able to learn to analyze GIS data using Python or SQL. 

I try to return the gifts from Open Source world writing articles and tutorial for GIS field and, recently, sharing my projects on GitHub.

If you think I am worthy of your trust give me a sponsorship for one of my actual and future projects. Become a part of my community. :rocket:
